Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ¤” I am Stacy Kioko, an undergradute student with a bachelors degree in International Business and Trade, pivoting to tech. 
I am currently learning different languages; HTML, CSS, Javascript, etc, that will make me become a full stack developer (Or maybe a front-end developer)
in the near future. My passion for development started when I was doing my thesis paper and I realized that the finance solutions 
that exist in Africa are not inclusive or well curated to fit the different profiles that exist in the continent. I therefore would 
like to develop/contribute to impacful solutions that will serve the needs and interests of as many people as possible by applying
the principles of Human Centered design as well as development.

ðŸ’¬ I am well versed with practical HCD knowlege and look forward to learning different technical languages.
