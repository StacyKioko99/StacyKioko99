Hi there 👋

🤔 I am Stacy Kioko, an undergradute student with a bachelors degree in International Business and trade, pivoting to tech. 
I am currently learning different languages; HTML, C++, Python, Javascript, etc, that will make me become a full stack developer 
in the near future. My passion for development started when I was doing my thesis paper and I realized that the finance solutions 
that exist in Africa are not inclusive or well curated to fit the different profiles that exist in the continent. I therefore would 
like to develop/contribute to impacful solutions that will serve the needs and interests of as many people as possible by applying
the principles of Human Centered design as well as full stack development.

💬 I am well versed with practical HCD knowlege and look forward to learning different technical languages.
